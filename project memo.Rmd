*An overview of your dataset*
I'm planning on doing my project on a predictive pricing model for homes in Sacramento based on a dataset from 2008. this is a file already in caret

**What does it include?**
It includes ~980 homes with sale price data, sale date, beds, baths, sqft, zip code.

**Where and how will you be obtaining it? Include the link and source.**
As mentioned above, it's online. caret. https://support.spatialkey.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Sacramentorealestatetransactions.csv

**About how many observations? How many predictors?**
~980, and about 12 predictors, but i dont expect to use all. 

**What types of variables will you be working with?**
Most, if not all, will be quantitative predictors. with the exception of house time, some may be homes, some condos

**Is there any missing data? About how much? Do you have an idea for how to handle it?**
yes, looks like roughly 40-50. i may omit it as 850 observations seem sufficient. 


*- An overview of your research question(s)*

**What variable(s) are you interested in predicting? What question(s) are you interested in answering?**
As I mentioned above, I'm looking to assess and predict how these variables relate to the asset's price. Hence, we would be building some sort of predictive model, where the inputs would be the property's attributes, and the output would be the price.

**Name your response/outcome variable(s) and briefly describe it/them.**
Response/outcome variable would be price, and it would basically be the market value for this asset based on the attributes we've provided, using the observations.

**Will these questions be best answered with a classification or regression approach?**
Definitely regression given the quantitative nature of our predictors

**Which predictors do you think will be especially useful?**
Square footage for sure, given that has a direct correlation on the income of the building. 

**Is the goal of your model descriptive, predictive, inferential, or a combination? Explain.**
I think, by nature, the model will be predictive, given we are looking to build a model where we could theoretically have an imaginary building, and assess where it would likely be priced at.

**- Your proposed project timeline**

*When do you plan on having your data set loaded, beginning your exploratory data analysis, etc?*
I already have the data, and its in csv already, so shouldn't be difficult to sort, and omit missing data. 

*Provide a general timeline for the rest of the quarter.*
It's hard to provide a timeline, because I'm not sure if it's just a simple lin. regression, or a different model.
However, I hope to clean the data in the first week, and begin to run different models with different predictors. However, I will likely need to use stepwise regression to see which variables work best.
From there, I can begin my analysis, including doing some case studies, where I'd compare the property values to their actual price, looking at residuals. additionally, i'd love to look at some macroeconomic data from sacramento to perform some analysis. looking at median home price, especially over time, and see how my data fits in...

**- Any questions or concerns**
*Are there any problems or difficult aspects of the project you anticipate?*

*Any specific questions you have for me/the instructional team?*
I think it was pretty much addressed above, and would love to have a deeper conversation about what the best course of action is, to address those issues.
